**CO2PPMBadge** is a simple app that reads CO2 PPM (Parts Per Million) information from available online APIs and generates badges and images that can be embedded in websites to raise awareness of the climate change crisis we are all facing on this planet.

# How to use

We want to provide a simple mean of communication that can be used on any website as a quick and identifiable tool that can be easily distributed across the internet.

**Please** visit the website [co2ppmbadge.piazza.energy](https://co2ppmbadge.piazza.energy/) for information on how to use the badges.
